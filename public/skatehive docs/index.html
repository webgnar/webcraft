<header>How to make a hive account</header>
<p>You need Hive Keychain browser extension or mobile app to store your wallet information securely.</p>
<p>You don't need to invest anything to make a Skatehive account. Making a hive account costs 3 HIVE.</p>
<p>There are resources for users to create free accounts. After you have installed Hive Keychain, go to one of these links to create an account</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hiveonboard.com/create-account">hive onboard</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ecency.com/signup">ecency</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://inleo.io/signup">in leo</a></li>
  <p>These are, essentially, large hive accounts that have a lot of resource credits, who have a lot of "free" accounts to give out. </p>
</ul>

<header>How to make a post</header>
<p>There are numerous Hive front-ends, that is, websites that use Hive blockchain to publish content.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://skatehive.app">skatehive.app</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://peakd.com/">peakD</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://inleo.io">in leo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ecency.com">ecency</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hive.blog">hive blog</a></li>   
     </ul> 
     <p>Any of these websites can be used to post into the Skatehive community. </p>
      <p>Skatehive.app automatically posts into the skatehive community, but on the other platforms, you have to make sure you select the Skatehive community when you publish skate content if you want the skatehive community to see and upvote your posts.</p>
     <p>There are other communities on Hive that you can post content into as well, like music, art, photography, crypto stuff, or computer stuff.</p>

<p>Hive as a blogging platoform is similar to reddit.</p>
<p>When other users upvote your post, Hive tokens from the global reward pool are delegated to your post.</p>
<p>The amount of Hive Power (staked hive) the user has, the more powerful thier upvote</p>
<p>At the end of 7 days, you are able to claim the amount of hive that users deemed your post worthy of.</p>

      <header>What is a DAO</header>
      <p>DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.</p>
      <p>DAO's are essentially crypto trust funds. Members of a DAO donate money into the fund by buying NFTs.</p>
      <p>The DAO's fund is called a treasury. Members of the DAO can write proposals for which to use the DAO treasury funds. </p>
      <p>Members of the DAO then vote on the proposals to determine if the proposal should pass. The amount of NFTs the member has determines thier vote weight in the proposal voting process.</p>
      <p>Most DAOs are on Ethereum.</p>
