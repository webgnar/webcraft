            Lots of new faces are joining us on a weekly basis so I thought it would be cool to do a throwback to Skatehive's history and talk about when/how everything started, how we evolved into a multi-chain community and what we have accomplished over the years. But first things first...        </p>
        <p>
            SkateHive is the house of Web 3.0 skateboarders and our goal is to onboard skaters and "extreme" artists in the blockchain world.        </p>
        <p>
            SkateHive is built on top of decentralized platforms that allow us to own our accounts, our communities, which means that instead of allowing others to advertise on our content to generate value, we tokenize interactions, allowing us to retain value generated by our content, to be sold on the free market in the form of cryptocurrency.

        <p>
            Everyting started in 2018 when @web-gnar organized the very first skateboarding contest on blockchain called "Steemit Skateboarding Contest". At that time there were only a handful of skaters in our community and we went with the name Steemskate since we were using Steem blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Steemit Skateboarding Contests" continued for many months and later down the road (2019) @web-gnar passed me the "torch" of Steemskate since he was too busy with life.

            Contests continued, me and the Steemskate folks kept onboarding people in our community, having fun recording clips and connecting with each other until something that made the headlines of every crypto site happened. In 2020 Justin Sun, founder of Tron blockchain bought Steemit and tried to centralize Steem Blockchain.        </p>
        <p>
            The choise was obvious. As a Web 3 community we stand for content ownership, decentralization and freedom. Steem didn't represent any of those 3 principles anymore so we re-branded our community from Steemskate to Skatehive and started operating solely on Hive blockchain.
